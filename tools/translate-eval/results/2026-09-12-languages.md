NLLB two-sentence line across 27 languages: whole 35%, split 51%. The nine
languages measured second (fi ca hu nb th cs ar id pl, `npx tsx
tmp/cpu-roundtrip.ts --langs fi,ca,hu,nb,th,cs,ar,id,pl`, q8 with basic graph
optimisation, as the app loads it): whole 27%, split 52%.

Each percentage is the content words found over the content words in the
English lines, summed over the cases: Qwen 3-9 chat shapes on the shipped
prompt; NLLB and OPUS a question, a casual line and the two-sentence line
(NLLB split into sentences, as the engine now sends it). s/line is the
question and casual round trips' time over their four translations, on
whatever else the runner's 56 cores were doing (the second batch ran on a
quieter machine, which is why it is faster). "Routed today" is the table
before these measurements.

## Where the table places each language

`client/js/translate/routes.default.ts`, reading differences under ~10
points as ties. Each placement applies to the language as the source and as
the target.

- **NLLB first, Qwen as the fallback class** (NLLB ahead by more than the tie
  band): sr, hr, sl, bg, el, he, fa, bn, ta, et, lv, lt, eu, ga, cy, is, sw,
  af, tl, ur, and from the second batch fi (+21), ca (+27), nb (+18), id
  (+24) and ar (+12: past the tie band, short of the 15 points the first
  batch's NLLB-first languages cleared; placed on the side of the
  measurement).
- **Qwen and NLLB in one class** (a downloaded NLLB preferred, Qwen
  otherwise): sk, ms, gl, hi, and from the second batch hu (-8), th (+6), cs
  (+8), pl (0).
- **Qwen and OPUS-MT in one class**: de, nl, ru. **Qwen, then OPUS-MT**: fr,
  es, it.
- **Qwen first, NLLB next**: pt, sv, da, ro, uk, tr, vi, zh, ja, ko, and any
  language not measured.

**Limited** (`LIMITED_LANGUAGES`, the best engine under 55%): is 43, lv 43,
et 49, hi 50, hu 52, lt 54, bn 54.
