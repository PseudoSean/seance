// Fabricate a network in the running app, without an ircd: the snippet
// dispatches the same `init` bus event a registration dispatches
// (client/js/irc/client.ts onRegistered → bus.dispatch("init")), so the
// store, sidebar and chat window render exactly what a real connection
// would show. Rendering-only scenarios (i18n direction checks) use this to
// get sidebar rows, a channel window with messages and the composer without
// dialling anything.
//
// window.socket is dev-build-only (client/js/socket.ts), so scenarios that
// use this must run against a development build; the snippet reports false
// when the exposure is missing so the scenario can fail loudly instead of
// silently skipping its assertions.
//
// Each dispatch merges one network into the store: a second call adds a
// second network — give it its own uuid, nick, channel name and a baseId
// that keeps the channel ids clear of the first network's (the store keys
// channels by id across networks). A disconnected network (connected:
// false) renders the connection bar on its channel window — the only way
// to that wave-A surface. The networks are memory-only: they live until
// the next navigation.

/**
 * JS source that evaluates to true when the dispatch ran, false when
 * `window.socket` is absent (production build).
 *
 * One network with a lobby, a channel (opened as the active window,
 * carrying a few messages) and a query row in the sidebar. The defaults
 * describe the connected "TestNet" rig the rtl-layout scenario loops over.
