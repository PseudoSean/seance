# Seance

A static, bouncer-less IRC client: the browser speaks IRCv3 to the server over a WebSocket and renders every line it receives. This glossary names the concepts in the message-rendering pipeline; other areas add their terms as they are sharpened.

## Message rendering

**Fragment**:
A run of message text that shares one presentation: IRC colour and style codes plus any Markdown flags. The unit everything after the parsers works on.
_Avoid_: span, segment, styled text

**Marker**:
A Markdown delimiter character sequence (`**`, `_`, `` ` ``, `> `, `||`, `[…](…)`). Markers are removed from the text they shape; unmatched markers are ordinary text.
_Avoid_: token, syntax, delimiter

**Opaque span**:
A stretch of text the Markdown tokenizer never interprets, such as a URL, so its characters cannot become markers.
_Avoid_: skip range, protected region

**Verbatim span**:
A stretch of text rendered exactly as written — inline code and code blocks — where neither Markdown nor the channel, nick and emoji finders apply. `findLinks` is the exception: it still runs, so a URL inside inline code is a link, while a code block renders only its characters and a URL inside one is not.
_Avoid_: code range, suppression hint

**Finder**:
A pass over the plain text that locates one kind of thing to make interactive: channels, links, emoji, nicks.
_Avoid_: matcher, detector

**Part**:
What a finder found, plus the plain text between findings: the horizontal division of a message into interactive and inert pieces.
_Avoid_: segment, chunk

**Layout tree**:
What a message renders as, decided once and expressed as plain data: parts and fragments nested inside wraps. Independent of Vue; every adapter (VNodes, plain text) walks the same tree.
_Avoid_: render tree, VNode tree, AST

**Wrap**:
A block-ish Markdown container in the layout tree — quote, header, list, table, code block, spoiler, math, or masked link — that encloses a run of neighbouring nodes.
_Avoid_: container, block, group

**Header**:
A line-level wrap giving a line document-heading emphasis, at one of six levels: `#` to `######` and a space at the start of the line. The level is the wrap's value, so two neighbouring lines of one level share a wrap and two of different levels do not.
_Avoid_: heading, title, hn

**Masked link**:
A `[text](url)` link whose visible text differs from its destination. Rendered with the destination in the title and a distinguishing class.
_Avoid_: markdown link, labelled link

**Code block**:
A verbatim span rendered as rows, one per line: numbered from a CSS counter once there are two or more, syntax-highlighted when the fence named a language or the guesser recognised one, and captioned above with the file a `lang:file` tag named, else the language — a label row, never an empty line of code. A fence is a run of three or more backticks closed by a run at least as long.
_Avoid_: fenced block, pre, snippet

**List**:
A run of `- ` or `1. `–`9. ` lines under one wrap, the markers removed and the bullet or number drawn by the stylesheet; the wrap's value is `ul` or `ol:` with the list's first number. They do not nest.
_Avoid_: bullet points, ul, ol

**Table**:
A GFM pipe table under one wrap: cells separated by pipes the scanner keeps, rows by the newlines it keeps, the separator row removed and its colons carried as the columns' alignment. Rendered as a real `<table>`, first row the header.
_Avoid_: grid, spreadsheet

**Math**:
A TeX span — `` $`…`$ `` inline, `$$…$$` display — rendered by KaTeX from a lazily loaded chunk, the raw TeX shown until it lands. The one place a library's HTML is set on the page directly, because KaTeX escapes everything it is given.
_Avoid_: latex block, formula, equation

**Shortcode**:
An `:name:` the emoji map knows, rendered as the character it stands for through the same span unicode emoji gets. Only a known alias matches, which is what keeps timestamps out.
_Avoid_: emoji name, smiley code

**Excerpt**:
The visible head of a collapsed code block — the first lines of a block too long to show whole, with a toggle under them offering the rest. The lines it leaves out are not in the DOM.
_Avoid_: preview, truncation, snippet, fold

**Monospace block**:
A server-produced multi-line message rendered verbatim in a monospace face — the MOTD. Never interpreted as Markdown.
_Avoid_: MOTD block, preformatted message

**Multi-line message**:
One message whose text contains line feeds — one msgid, one timeline entry, one thing to reply to, react to, edit or delete, however many lines it shows. Only possible where the server and client have agreed to it; where they have not, each line is a message of its own.
_Avoid_: multiline batch, paragraph, block message

## Sending

**Pending copy**:
Our own message shown faded, at the bottom of the timeline, from the moment its line is on the wire until the server's echo replaces it or a failure takes it down. Exists only where `echo-message` makes the server the source of the timeline copy; without it the local echo is the copy, at once. It has no msgid, so nothing can refer to it.
_Avoid_: optimistic message, unsent message, ghost message, placeholder, pending message (that is the input box's draft, `ClientChan.pendingMessage`)

**Settled**:
What happens to a pending copy when the server has answered for it, whichever way: replaced by the echo, taken down with an error line, or taken down silently after an `ACK`.
_Avoid_: confirmed, acknowledged, resolved

## Translation

**engine**:
One of the two translators behind `Engine`: the **LLM** (WebLLM, GPU) or **seq2seq** (transformers.js, CPU: **NLLB** or an **OPUS-MT pair model**).
_Avoid_: model backend, translation provider

**candidate**:
An entry of the route table: `llm`, `nllb` or `opus:<from>-<to>`; the **router** resolves a pair to the first candidate the **tier** (`gpu`/`cpu`/`none`, from the **probe**), the engine settings and the session's **down-marks** allow.
_Avoid_: route entry, option

**catalog**:
The models a deploy knows (`models.ts`), the shipped defaults plus `config.json`'s `translation` block; a **mirror** is `translation.modelBase`.
_Avoid_: model list, registry

**span protection**:
Placeholders (`⟦1⟧`) standing in for URLs, code, shortcodes and formatting codes while an engine works.
_Avoid_: masking, tokenization (that is the engine's own, internal, tokenizer)

**model view**:
A Settings row: cached, downloading (with a fraction), ready or failed.
_Avoid_: model state, download entry

**switch**:
A channel's reading target: a language code, or off. Set from the header globe or the panel; the moment it was set (`since`) is recorded so older messages are never translated.
_Avoid_: toggle state, read flag

**chip**:
The "from German" button on a translated line (`TranslationLine.vue`), full language name; opens the retranslate/hide menu.
_Avoid_: badge, label

**prior**:
A channel's dominant detected language so far (`LanguagePrior`), used to settle a near-tie in detection and as the sourceHint the prompt carries.
_Avoid_: bias, running average

**drop**:
A queued line the queue gave up on because too many messages arrived in its channel before an engine got to it (`DROP_AFTER_LINES`); shown as no translation at all, not a failure.
_Avoid_: skip, expire

**pause**:
An engine set aside after `PAUSE_AFTER_FAILURES` consecutive failures, until a retry resumes it; global to the engine, not per channel.
_Avoid_: disable, blacklist

**write target**:
A channel's outgoing language, set from the panel and persisted alongside the reading **switch** (`thelounge.translate` `write`); `writeTarget()` returns it whenever translation is enabled, without waiting on the device probe.
_Avoid_: send language, outgoing switch

**the strip**:
The `.translate-bar` above the input (`ChatInput.vue`) that shows a draft's outgoing translation: the chip, the streaming text, Check/Send/Edit, and the read-back row underneath. A different draft, a channel switch, Escape or the strip's own Edit takes it down.
_Avoid_: translation bar, preview box

**the first Enter / the second Enter**:
The first Enter on a draft with a write target starts its translation (`translateOutgoing`) instead of sending; the second Enter, once the strip shows a result (or a failure), sends what the strip holds.
_Avoid_: initial submit, confirm submit

**read back**:
The round trip: a done translation translated once more, back toward the user's reading language, shown under the strip so a failed or a subtly wrong translation can be caught before sending. `"auto"` runs it as soon as the translation ends; `"button"` waits for Check.
_Avoid_: back-translation, verification pass

**voice lines**:
The user's own last few sent translations to one target, session-only, quoted in the next prompt to that target (`VOICE_LINES` = 5 of up to `VOICE_KEEP` kept).
_Avoid_: style examples, tone memory

**term pair**:
A term-sized draft and its translation (`termPair`: at most `TERM_MAX_WORDS` words and `TERM_MAX_CHARS` characters, one line, translation short and different) that a sent message leaves in the channel's term memory; a sentence never qualifies.
_Avoid_: glossary entry, learned term

**hold**:
`holdReading()`/`releaseReading()`: the reading queues pause new runs while a draft translates (a run already in flight finishes), so a write is never starved behind reading traffic; nested holds count.
_Avoid_: pause, lock
