# Message editing & deletion

_Noted 2026-08-27 as a backlog item. Status: **already implemented** for the
common case (see below); this file tracks what is left and what to decide._

## What exists today

Spec: `docs/resources/bus-contract.md` § 1.4; server facts:
`docs/resources/nefarious2-websocket.md` § "REDACT / TAGMSG / client tags".

- **Delete** — `REDACT <channel> <msgid> [:reason]` (`draft/message-redaction`).
  `client.redact()` sends; `handlers/redact.ts` dispatches `msg:redact`; the
  store marks `msg.redacted = {by, reason, time}` and `Message.vue` renders
  "[Message deleted by …]" with click-to-reveal. `/redact <msgid> [reason]`
  (alias `/delete`) and the trash action in `MessageActions.vue`. `FAIL REDACT <code>` surfaces as an error line.
- **Edit** — no wire standard. Seance emulates it: `REDACT <chan> <old> :edited`, wait for the echoed REDACT (or FAIL / 5 s timeout), then
  `@+seance/edit=<old msgid> PRIVMSG <chan> :new text`. `client.editMessage()`,
  `privmsg.ts` sets `msg.editOf`, `msg:edit` hides the old message
  (`supersededBy`) and the new one shows "(edited)". Pencil action in
  `MessageActions.vue`; `input` carries an optional `edit` msgid.
- Both are replayed correctly from `draft/chathistory` (`client.afterReplay`).

## Gaps / decisions

- **Server policy:** `draft/message-redaction` is **off by default** in
  nefarious2 (`CAP_draft_message_redaction`); only `tools/nefarious-dev/local.conf`
  turns it on. Production networks must enable it and pick `REDACT_WINDOW`
  (default 300 s). Document this in the deploy notes.
- **Queries:** REDACT is channels-only (`FAIL REDACT INVALID_TARGET`), so
  deleting in a PM is impossible and editing there degrades to "send a second
  message". Decide whether to hide the edit/delete actions in queries rather
  than offer a half-working one.
- **Edit semantics are Seance-only:** other clients see a deletion followed by
  a new message with an unknown client tag. Acceptable for a network shipping
  its own client, but worth stating in the UI/help. Watch IRCv3 for a message
  edit spec and switch to it if one lands.
- **Window expiry UX:** after `REDACT_WINDOW` the author can no longer edit or
  delete (unless logged in / chanop). The actions still show; they fail with
  `REDACT_WINDOW_EXPIRED`. Could hide them once the message is older than the
  window (window length is not advertised in ISUPPORT — maybe a branding
  setting).
- **Edit ordering:** the emulation does REDACT first, then PRIVMSG. If the
  PRIVMSG is rejected (flood, +m) the original is already gone. Consider
  sending the new message first and redacting on echo.
- **History without the cap:** if `draft/message-redaction` is not negotiated
  (server has it disabled) chathistory still filters deleted messages but the
  client never sees the REDACT lines — verify nothing is left hanging.
- **Tests:** `test/irc/` covers redact/edit handlers; add a live-test case in
  `test/irc/*.live.ts` for the full edit round-trip once the live suites can
  run together (open follow-up in CLAUDE.md).
