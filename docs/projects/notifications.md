# Notifications: best possible, on every platform

_Noted 2026-08-27. Status: exploration → plan. Supersedes plan item D.11
(web push) in `initial_conversion.md`. Related: `docs/resources/pwa.md`,
`connecting-status-stuck.md`, the Capacitor/Electron READMEs in `shells/`._

## Goal

Figure out what "great notifications" can mean for a bouncer-less web IRC
client on desktop, Android and iOS — including push while the app is not
running — and do everything that is feasible: grouping of repeated messages,
snoozing / do-not-disturb, per-channel levels, badges, sane click-through,
cross-device dismissal.

## Where we are

- **In-app only.** `client/js/socket-events/msg.ts` `notifyMessage()` fires on
  highlights (or every message with `notifyAllMessages`) when the tab is
  unfocused or another channel is active, skipping `channel.muted`
  (`client/js/mute.ts`). It plays `pop` and, with `desktopNotifications`
  granted, posts `{type: "notification", chanId, title, body, timestamp}` to
  the service worker (`client/service-worker.js` `showNotification`) or falls
  back to `new Notification()`.
- **Grouping today** = the notification `tag` is `chan-<id>`: a new
  notification for the same channel closes and replaces the previous one. No
  count, no "3 messages from alice", no batching window.
- **Click** → `notificationclick` focuses/opens the app and posts
  `{type: "open", channel: "chan-<id>"}` → `router.ts` switches channel. Ids
  come from `client/js/irc/ids.ts` and are **session-local**, so a
  notification that outlives the page (push, or a closed PWA window) cannot
  address a channel by id.
- **No push.** `client/js/webpush.ts` is a stub (`pushNotificationState: "unsupported"`); the worker has no `push` handler. The old TheLounge relay
  (`attic/server/plugins/webpush.ts`) is gone with the server.
- **Settings** (`client/components/Settings/Notifications.vue`,
  `client/js/settings.ts`): `desktopNotifications`, `notification` (sound),
  `notifyAllMessages`, `highlights`, `highlightExceptions`, plus per-channel
  mute in the context menu. No badge, no schedule, no levels.
- **Read markers exist** (`draft/read-marker`, `handlers/markread.ts`, plan
  D.7 done 2026-08-25): the cross-device "already read" signal we need for
  dismissing notifications is available.

## The three delivery layers

1. **Live connection (app open or backgrounded but alive).** Desktop
   browsers, the PWA window, Electron: the WebSocket stays up, the page
   decides what to notify. Everything here is client-side work.
2. **Web Push (app closed, or mobile OS killed the socket).** The push
   service (FCM / Apple / Mozilla) wakes the service worker with an encrypted
   payload. Needs a sender: with no bouncer, that must be **the ircd**.
3. **Native push in the shells.** Capacitor iOS/Android WebViews have no
   Push API; they need APNs/FCM via a native plugin and something that
   translates Web Push (RFC 8030) into APNs/FCM — see "Shells" below.

## Server side: IRCv3 `draft/webpush` and nefarious2

Spec: [ircv3-specifications#471](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/471)
(`extensions/webpush.md` on the `webpush` branch). Capability `draft/webpush`.

- `WEBPUSH REGISTER <endpoint> <keys>` (keys = `p256dh` + `auth` from
  `PushSubscription.toJSON()`), `WEBPUSH UNREGISTER <endpoint>`; success is
  echoed back. Re-registering the same endpoint replaces the subscription.
- VAPID public key advertised in ISUPPORT (spec: `VAPIDPUBKEY`; nefarious2's
  doc/code uses `VAPID=<key>` — **verify which name the branch emits**,
  `s_user.c` / `m_webpush.c:631`). The key is stable for the life of a TCP
  connection.
- Each push carries **one raw IRC line** (no CRLF, tags may be dropped to fit
  4 KB, first line of multiline only), encrypted per RFC 8291 `aes128gcm`.
  The server chooses which messages to push ("server-defined subset").
- `FAIL WEBPUSH INVALID_ENDPOINT | INVALID_KEYS | MAX_REGISTRATIONS | INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- Implementations: soju, Ergo, Igloo (servers); goguma (Android),
  gamja (web PoC); **pushgarden** (Web Push → FCM relay) for native apps.

nefarious2 `ircv3.2-upgrade` (`tmp/nefarious2/ircd/m_webpush.c`,
`webpush.c`, `webpush_store.c`; checkout at `21ec6d2`):

- Cap is **default off** (`FEAT_CAP_draft_webpush`); needs
  `FEAT_WEBPUSH_DB` (LMDB path) and a VAPID private key
  (`FEAT_WEBPUSH_VAPID_PRIVKEY`, or generated/shared via services). The
  dev conf in `tools/nefarious-dev/` sets none of this yet.
- `WEBPUSH REGISTER` **requires a logged-in account**
  (`FAIL WEBPUSH ACCOUNT_REQUIRED`, non-spec code; also `INVALID_PARAMS`).
  Subscriptions are stored per **account**, not per connection, and synced
  network-wide over P10 (`WP V/R/U/B`). So push needs services + SASL — fine
  for a network's own client, but the dev ircd has no services.
- Delivery exists (`webpush_notify_account()` iterates the account's
  subscriptions, prunes HTTP 410), **but nothing calls it**: as of this
  checkout there is no hook in PRIVMSG/NOTICE/INVITE delivery. Registration
  works, no push is ever sent. That trigger is the first piece of server work
  and a natural follow-up PR after #100 (WebSocket fixes). Proposed policy,
  to agree with MrLenin:
  - push on PMs, highlights (server-side mention = nick in text; the client's
    custom `highlights` list can't be known server-side unless sent — the
    `draft/metadata-2` cap on the branch could carry it) and INVITE;
  - only when the account has **no connected session**, or every session is
    away (`away-notify` semantics) — otherwise the live layer handles it;
  - honour a per-subscription or per-account mute list (channel + until) so
    that snooze/DND work while the app is closed (not in the spec; could
    ride on `METADATA` or a `WEBPUSH` extension);
  - rate limit per account/endpoint; include `msgid`/`time` tags in the
    pushed line so the worker can dedupe against chathistory on open.

Notes: iOS suspends the WebSocket seconds after backgrounding, so on iPhone
layer 2 is the _only_ way to be notified; Android is friendlier but Doze
still kills the socket. Apple announced then reversed removing Home Screen
web apps in the EU (iOS 17.4, 2024) — verify current behaviour per region
before promising iOS push to an EU network. Sources:

## Client-side push design (layer 2)

- **Subscribe** after SASL login succeeds and `draft/webpush` is negotiated:
  `registration.pushManager.subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true, applicationServerKey: <VAPID from ISUPPORT>})`, then
  `WEBPUSH REGISTER <endpoint> p256dh=<...>,auth=<...>` (exact `<keys>`
  syntax per the spec text). Re-register on every connect (cheap, refreshes
  expiry), on `pushsubscriptionchange`, and when the VAPID key changes.
  `WEBPUSH UNREGISTER` on explicit logout / disabling push / removing the
  network. Persist `{endpoint, network uuid}` in `thelounge.push`.
- **Worker `push` handler**: decrypting is done by the browser; the event
  data is the IRC line. Parse it with `client/js/irc/message.ts` — the
  parser has no DOM/store deps, so give the worker its own webpack entry
  (`client/service-worker.ts`, sharing `message.ts` + a tiny render module)
  instead of the hand-copied JS it is today. Map `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE`/`INVITE`/
  `MARKREAD` to show/close notifications; anything else → ignore (still
  must show something? no — Chrome only requires a notification when the
  push _should_ be user-visible; log and skip is tolerated occasionally, but
  don't make the server push things the worker will drop).
- **Dedup on open**: the page replays chathistory on connect; notifications
  for msgids already marked read (`MARKREAD` timestamp) are closed on boot.
- **Permission UX**: ask only from a user gesture on a "Enable notifications
  on this device" button (iOS is strict); explain the Home-Screen requirement
  on iOS; show `pushNotificationState` (`unsupported` / `not-installed` /
  `denied` / `subscribed`) in Settings → Notifications.
- **Multi-network**: one push subscription per browser profile (the endpoint
  is per SW registration), registered with each network the user logs in to;
  the pushed IRC line has no network marker — include the network in the
  `WEBPUSH` registration or tag the notification by the server-name in the
  line's prefix. Open question for the spec.

## Shells

- **Electron**: no push service, but the app process keeps the socket open;
  layer 1 is enough. Use `Notification` + `app.setBadgeCount`, and macOS
  reply actions via the shell's `main.js`.
- **Capacitor**: `@capacitor/push-notifications` gives an FCM/APNs token, but
  the ircd speaks Web Push. Options: (a) run **pushgarden**-style relay
  (Web Push endpoint that forwards to FCM/APNs) — a small piece of network
  infrastructure, contrary to the bouncer-less goal but tiny and stateless;
  (b) extend nefarious2 to talk FCM/APNs directly (bigger, vendor-specific);
  (c) accept "installed PWA" as the mobile story and keep Capacitor for
  stores only. Leaning (c) + (a) if a network wants store apps with push.

## Plan

1. **Live-layer polish** (no server dependency): stable deep links by
   network/target, grouping + batching in the worker, badge, per-channel
   levels, snooze/DND in IndexedDB, actions on Chrome/Android, cross-device
   close on `markread`, worker built from TypeScript with the shared parser.
2. **Web push**: agree the server trigger policy with MrLenin and land it in
   nefarious2 (`webpush_notify_account` callers + away/no-session rule +
   mute list); add VAPID + LMDB to the dev ircd (`tools/nefarious-dev/`) —
   needs services for accounts, so either bring up X3 in the dev compose or
   patch a dev-only "no account required" feature flag; client subscribe /
   register lifecycle; worker `push` handler; Settings UX; iOS install hint.
   Live test in `test/irc/webpush.live.ts` against the dev ircd (registration
   round-trip; actual delivery needs a real push service, so a manual check
   on a real phone).
3. **Shells**: decide (a)/(c) above once the PWA path works on a real Android
   and iPhone.

## Open questions

- Exact `WEBPUSH REGISTER <keys>` encoding and the ISUPPORT token name in the
  spec vs nefarious2 (`VAPIDPUBKEY` vs `VAPID`).
- Should the server push to accounts with a _connected but away_ session, or
  only with no session? (Desktop left on at home vs phone in pocket.)
- Where do highlight words live for server-side matching — `METADATA`?
- How much of the message body to put in a notification on a locked phone
  (privacy setting: "show sender only").
- EU iOS behaviour at the time we ship.
