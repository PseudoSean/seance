# Reactions and the emoji picker

A reaction is a `+draft/react` tag carrying **free text** (bus-contract §1.4).
That is the fact the whole UI is built around: `👍` is a reaction, so is
`🎉🎉🎉`, and so is `lol`. Nothing anywhere assumes one emoji, one grapheme or
even one word.

## Where a reaction comes from

| Entry point                                         | Lives in                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| The 😀 button on a message's hover toolbar          | `client/components/MessageActions.vue`   |
| The `+` at the end of an existing reaction row      | `client/components/MessageReactions.vue` |
| Clicking a reaction badge (adds or takes yours off) | `MessageReactions.vue`                   |
| `/react <text> [msgid]`, `/unreact …`               | `client/js/irc/commands/react.ts`        |

All of them end at `socket.emit("msg:react", {target, msgid, text, remove})`,
which the IRC layer turns into one TAGMSG. `remove` is decided from
`myReactions(message, nick)` (`client/js/helpers/messageUpdates.ts`): picking
something you already reacted with takes it back off, from the picker as well
as from the badge, so there is one toggle and not two verbs.

`/react` takes everything up to an optional trailing msgid as the reaction, so
`/react so cool` sends "so cool". A last word only counts as a msgid when it
names a message **loaded in this channel** (`Channel.idOf`) — the client knows
which msgids are real here, and no shape heuristic could tell `awesome` from
an opaque id. `:shortcodes:` are expanded on the way out, the same as in the
picker.

## The picker (`ReactionPicker.vue`)

One component, opened from either anchor, `<Teleport>`ed to `<body>` because
the scrollback would otherwise clip it, and positioned from JS against the
button it belongs to: below it, flipped above when there is no room, clamped
into the viewport, re-pinned on scroll and resize, and closed once the message
it belongs to has scrolled away. Under 480px wide it is a sheet along the
bottom edge instead, and the search field does not take focus on a coarse
pointer — the on-screen keyboard would cover what the user came to tap.

Its parts, top to bottom:

- **Search / type field.** Doubles as the free-text entry: whatever is typed is
  offered as a reaction of its own ("React with …"), which is how a word or a
  run of emoji is sent from a desktop with no emoji keyboard. Where that row
  sits decides what Enter does, because the first option is the highlighted
  one: an **exact** alias (`tada`, `:tada:`, `+1`) is somebody naming an emoji,
  so the emoji comes first; anything else (`lol`, `same`, `brb`) is words, so
  the text row comes first and the emoji it happens to prefix — 🍭 lollipop for
  `lol` — is one keypress away. Searching itself is looser than that: `party popper` and `flag de` find what they describe.
- **Group tabs**, the nine Unicode groups plus the recents row, with a scroll
  spy keeping the current one lit.
- **The list**, sections with sticky headings. One delegated click and one
  delegated hover handler for ~1900 options, and `role="listbox"` with
  `aria-activedescendant` on the field, so the field keeps focus and the
  keyboard drives the grid: ↑/↓ move a row (found by geometry — sections wrap
  and a remembered word is wider than an emoji, so there is no column count to
  count), ←/→ move one, but only once the caret has nowhere left to go, and
  Enter sends what is highlighted. Reactions already on the message are ticked.
- **Building a combination**: shift-click (or Shift+Enter on the highlighted
  option) adds an emoji to the field instead of sending it, so `🎉🔥👍` is a
  reaction you can click together — something only a free-text reaction can
  be, which is why no other client's picker has a pattern to copy. The rules
  that keep it out of an ordinary click's way:
  - The field holds what is being built, so **a field that is only emoji is
    not a search**: the grid stays exactly where it was, because the next
    emoji to add is in it. Type a letter and it goes back to searching.
  - The preview bar becomes the composition — what is built so far, "Building
    a reaction", and a Send — whenever nothing is highlighted.
  - While building, **hovering does not move the highlight**. `:hover` still
    lights the cell and the arrow keys still move, but Enter goes on meaning
    "send what you built" instead of being rewritten by a pointer passing
    over the grid.
  - `appendReaction` (`helpers/emoji.ts`, tested) is the join rule: emoji sit
    flush together, anything with a word in it keeps a space, and an addition
    that would pass `MAX_REACTION_LENGTH` is refused rather than cut.
- **Preview bar**: the highlighted emoji, its `:shortcode:` and its
  description, and one line for what would happen to it — "Remove" for one of
  yours, "Enter to send" on the free-text row, "⇧ to combine" otherwise. It is
  the tooltip, so the options carry no `title`: an OS tooltip fading in over
  the grid is exactly the thing a picker should not do. They are not tab stops either
  (`tabindex="-1"`), or Tab would walk 1878 buttons, and each one's accessible
  name is its description rather than the glyph.

Only one picker is ever open. An opener stops the mousedown that would
otherwise reach the document — that is what lets its own button toggle — which
is also the event the outside-click handler waits for, so a second picker
would otherwise leave the first on screen. Each announces itself on the event
bus as it mounts (`reaction-picker-opened`) and any other closes.

The catalog is fetched on `mouseenter` of either opener, so by the time the
click lands the grid is usually already there.

### Recently used

`client/js/helpers/reactionRecents.ts` keeps the last 36 reactions **sent from
the UI** in `localStorage` under `thelounge.reactions.recent`, newest first,
deduplicated. They are whole reaction strings, words included, and they open
the picker as its first section; before there is any history the section shows
`DEFAULT_REACTIONS` instead. `/react` does not feed the list: it records what
was picked here, not everything that was ever sent.

### The catalog

`client/js/helpers/emoji-catalog.json` is generated from the `gemoji`
devDependency by `tools/generate-emoji-catalog.mjs` — 1870 emoji in nine
groups, each with its primary shortcode, description and keywords, as tuples.
Regenerate it (and re-run prettier over it) only when the dep is bumped; the
generator fails loudly if gemoji grows a category the tab bar has no group for,
or a name `findShortcode` would not recognise.

`emoji.ts` reaches it through `loadEmojiCatalog()`, an `import()` — the data is
its own ~88 kB chunk (`public/js/emoji-catalog.js`) that nobody downloads until
they open the picker. `searchEmoji()` scores every token against the name, then
the description and keywords, and requires all of them to match, so `red heart`
finds ❤️ rather than everything red; ties keep Unicode order.

`normalizeReaction()` is the one gate before sending: shortcodes expanded,
control characters and whitespace runs flattened, trimmed, and cut to
`MAX_REACTION_LENGTH` (64) **code points** — a `slice` would split a surrogate
pair. `IrcClient.sendTagmsg` still refuses anything that will not fit in
`MAX_LINE_BYTES` once escaped, which is the real limit.

### Rendering a word reaction

`isEmojiOnly()` decides how a badge is set: emoji at full size, anything else
as a text pill, ellipsised at 22ch with the full text and the nicks in the
tooltip (`data-tooltip`, the app's own primer tooltip, not the OS one). The
picker does the same for remembered reactions and for the "React with …" row.

Being teleported out of `#chat-container` costs the picker anything a theme
scopes to it — `themes/morning.css` puts its placeholder colour there, so the
search field fell back to the global `rgb(0 0 0 / 35%)` and was a smudge on
the dark theme. Style the picker from the `:root` variables only, and the
scenario measures the placeholder's contrast on both themes (>= 4.5:1).

Emoji are set in `--emoji-font` wherever they are shown: a system with more
than one emoji font otherwise picks its own, and some of those are monochrome.
Latin text falls through the stack to the UI font, so it is only ever set on
elements that hold emoji.

A badge that arrives while you are looking pops in (`TransitionGroup`, 160 ms,
off under `prefers-reduced-motion`); the ones already there when a channel is
drawn do not, which is what `appear` being off buys.

## Tests

- `test/helpers/emoji.ts` — catalog shape, search ranking, normalisation.
- `test/helpers/reactionRecents.ts` — the MRU list and its storage.
- `test/tests/messageUpdates.ts` — `applyReaction` and `myReactions`.
- `test/irc/reactions.ts` — the wire side and `/react`'s argument rules.

No test mounts the picker (the suite has no DOM), so the parts only a browser
can show — where the popover lands, the lazily loaded catalog, keyboard
navigation, the round trip through the ircd and the phone-sized sheet — are a
scenario instead:

```sh
corepack yarn build && python3 -m http.server -d public 8000 &
tools/nefarious-dev/run.sh -d
node tools/browser-drive.mjs tools/scenarios/reaction-picker.mjs
```

See `docs/resources/browser-testing.md`. The channel keeps history, so the
scenario marks its own message and works only on that one; and it waits out
the 120 ms entrance animation before measuring anything, or it measures the
animation's rect rather than the layout's.
