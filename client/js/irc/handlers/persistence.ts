/**
 * `PERSISTENCE` replies (draft/persistence, see ../persistence.ts):
 *
 *   :server PERSISTENCE STATUS <client-setting> <effective>
 *        — `ON|OFF|DEFAULT` (what the user asked for) then `ON|OFF` (what
 *          the server will actually do). Sent unsolicited between 005 and
 *          the MOTD end, after a SET, and for `/persistence status`.
 *          nefarious2 sent the effective state alone before 7a47da1, so
 *          the effective state is read as the *last* parameter.
 *   :server PERSISTENCE SET ON|OFF|DEFAULT      (the ack; a STATUS follows)
 *   :server PERSISTENCE REPLAY STATUS <client-setting> <effective>
 *   :server PERSISTENCE ATTACH <profile>        (the ack of our ATTACH)
 *   :server PERSISTENCE DETACH|PROFILE …
 *
 *   :server PERSISTENCE SESSION <sessid> <state> <nick> <channels> :<info>
 *   :server PERSISTENCE ENDOFLIST              (the close of a LIST)
 *   :server PERSISTENCE DETACH OK|NOSESSION    (the ack of our force-logout)
 *
 * Only the effective state matters to us ({@link IrcClient.persistenceHold},
 * read at the end of registration by ../persistence.ts). The registration
 * line is not shown; anything the user asked for is. The `ATTACH` ack of the
 * catch-up cursor we offered before `CAP END` is silent too — it only says
 * the server will replay the gap itself.
