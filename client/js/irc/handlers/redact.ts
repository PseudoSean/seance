/**
 * REDACT (`draft/message-redaction`): `:nick!u@h REDACT <channel> <msgid> [:reason]`.
 *
 * nefarious2 sends the live line with no tags at all (so the time is "now")
 * and only to clients that negotiated the cap; inside chathistory batches
 * the same line carries `time`/`msgid` tags and the deleted message itself
 * is no longer replayed. The redaction becomes `msg:redact {chan, id, by,
 * reason?, time}` for a loaded message; for one we never showed it is a
 * plain "<nick> deleted a message" line (live) or dropped (replay). A
 * REDACT of our own that an edit is waiting on releases that edit
 * (`IrcClient.settleEdit`).
