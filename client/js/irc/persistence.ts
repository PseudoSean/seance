/**
 * `draft/persistence` — nefarious2's built-in bouncer, from the client's
 * side. While a logged-in user's session is "held", a dropped connection
 * leaves no channel: the next connection with the same account resumes the
 * session and, right behind the MOTD, the server replays the membership it
 * kept as a `BATCH +ref draft/persistence` of JOIN (with the original
 * `@time`/`msgid`), 332/333, MARKREAD and NAMES per channel
 * (`bouncer_session.c` `bounce_send_channel_state`). A client that
 * requested the cap is also told between 005 and the MOTD end whether it is
 * held at all: `:server PERSISTENCE STATUS ON|OFF`.
 *
 * Seance uses this to make a reconnect look like nothing happened:
 *
 * - the replayed JOIN / topic / NAMES update the model without producing
 *   lines (`IrcClient.restoring`, honoured by join.ts and topic.ts) and each
 *   restored JOIN starts the usual paced `CHATHISTORY AFTER` catch-up
 *   (catchup.ts), which is what actually fills the gap — unless the server
 *   is filling it itself, see {@link serverReplayCovers};
 * - after `STATUS ON` the autojoin `JOIN` waits for that batch (or
 *   {@link RESTORE_WAIT_MS}, whichever is first) and then covers only the
 *   channels the server did not restore. JOINing a channel the server is
 *   restoring anyway is ignored at best and, while another client of the
 *   account is attached, answered with a second topic + NAMES burst.
 *
 * On a server that offers the `attach-cursor` token the whole per-channel
 * dance is replaced by one line: `PERSISTENCE ATTACH default <msgid>` in the
 * flush that carries `CAP END` hands the server the newest msgid we hold, and
 * it replays the gap itself (see {@link attachCursorLine} and
 * {@link bouncerReplayBatch}).
 *
 * Without the cap (another ircd, hold off, not logged in) nothing here runs
 * and a re-JOIN is quiet by `Channel.rejoining` alone.
