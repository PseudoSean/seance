/**
 * Pending outgoing messages (docs/resources/bus-contract.md §1.9).
 *
 * With `echo-message` it is the server, not the client, that produces the
 * copy of a sent message that goes into the timeline — so until the echo
 * arrives the user would see nothing of what they just typed. This module
 * shows a *pending copy* the moment the line is on the wire (an ordinary
 * `msg` event whose message has `pending: true`) and takes it down again
 * (`msg:settled`) when the server answers: with the echo itself, with a
 * numeric rejecting the line, with a labelled `ACK`, with a `FAIL` for a
 * multiline batch, when the connection closes, or after
 * {@link PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS} of silence.
 *
 * The echo is matched to its copy by `labeled-response` label: every line
 * goes out as `@label=s<n>`, and nefarious2 puts the label on the echo (on
 * the batch opener for a multiline one) and on the numeric that rejects it
 * (probed 2026-09-04). Without that cap the oldest copy of the same kind in
 * the channel is taken, an exact text match first — echoes come back in the
 * order the lines went out.
 *
 * Copies bypass `IrcClient.pushMessage` on purpose: a line the server has
 * not taken must not move the read marker, count towards the history
 * total, or hold an id the catch-up cursor could refer to.
