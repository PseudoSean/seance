/**
 * `draft/multiline` (https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multiline).
 *
 * A multi-line message travels as a `BATCH … draft/multiline <target>` whose
 * lines are ordinary `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE`s: they are joined with `\n`, except
 * where a line carries {@link CONCAT_TAG}, which glues it to the previous one
 * with no separator (that is how a paragraph longer than the line budget is
 * split). One batch is one message: one msgid, one timeline entry.
 *
 * Sending is paced: the server charges a cooldown per delivered batch and
 * drops one opened inside it, so batches go out one at a time and a cooldown
 * re-sends rather than loses them (see {@link MultilineQueue}).
 *
 * This module is store- and DOM-free (it runs under mocha).
