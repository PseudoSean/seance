 * The "seen" ring: msgids this live page has already received over its own

 *
 * Server pushes reach the device even while an idle-but-attached bouncer
 * session exists (the ircd's FEAT_WEBPUSH_IDLE opens the HOLDING-only
 * gate), so a backgrounded tab's messages can arrive twice: once over the
 * WebSocket, once via FCM. The page records the msgid of every pushable
 * message it takes (a live page owns its notifications — its own rules in
 * socket-events/msg.ts decide what the user sees); the service worker's
 * push handler drops any push whose msgid is already here. No live page,
 * no record — the push shows. A frozen page never writes, which is
 * exactly when the push is wanted.
 *
 * IndexedDB, not localStorage: the worker must be able to read it. One
 * ring under the same DB the worker already uses (seance-push/kv), capped;
 * a lost entry costs at worst one duplicate notification.
