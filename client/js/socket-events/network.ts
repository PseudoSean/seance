 * so a deep link or a remembered channel that is one of them is shown at
 * once. One that is not (a private conversation, a channel a held session
 * will restore) is waited for in the lobby: the `network:status` handler
 * below reopens a query once registered, and socket-events/join.ts lands on
 * the join when it comes. Waiting in the lobby rather than on a placeholder
 * matters — what is shown is what gets remembered, and an automatic stop
 * must not overwrite the memory.
 *
 * None of that on a page the user opened on purpose (settings, help, …): the
 * networks boot dials there come up in the sidebar and the view stays put —
 * the remembered conversation is left for them to open, and no landing is
 * begun for it. A deep link is different: the user asked for it.
