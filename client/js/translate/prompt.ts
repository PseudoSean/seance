// Prompt assembly for the LLM (spec § prompt.ts). The system message is
// short (WebLLM has no prompt cache, so every token is paid on every
// request) and generic: nothing from the channel is interpolated into it.
// Everything other people wrote — the context lines, the nicks, the
// glossary, the user's own earlier messages — goes in the user message,
// labelled and quoted, the last three under `DATA_HEADING`, and the
// context is trimmed from the oldest end to `CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET`.
// Batched requests are numbered lines in and out, closed by `END_SENTINEL`.
//
// The whole frame is built around what a small instruct model does with a
// chat transcript ending in a message addressed to it: it answers it. So
// the system message says what this is before it says anything else (a
// translation engine, never a participant) and the earlier lines are
// labelled as context that is not to be translated or answered.
//
// The message itself is not fenced. A fence was tried and made things
// worse: given `"""…"""` the model stopped answering the line and started
// echoing or continuing it instead, in the source language. What it
// answers correctly is the plainest shape there is — `Translate into
// German: <text>` on one line.
//
// The rest of the shape was measured against the model itself with
// `tools/translate-llm.ts` over `tools/translate-eval/prompts.json`
// (docs/resources/translation.md § Testing prompts offline), and every
// clause below is there because the numbers moved:
//
//   No worked example. `Example: hello, how are you? → hallo, wie geht es
//   dir?` above the line was copied rather than read: given a line that
//   mentions the target language or carries placeholders the model replied
//   with the example's own answer, and given the user's own line it
//   translated the first word and copied the rest ("hallo this is supposed
//   to be in *German*" — the bug this measurement started from). Offering
//   the pair as prior chat turns instead (system, user, assistant, user)
//   was measured too and scored no better. Nothing shows an example now,
//   and the engine refuses an answer that is one anyway (`EXAMPLES`).
//
//   `nick: text` for the earlier lines, not `<nick> text`. With angle
//   brackets a line that arrived with context came back untranslated, and
//   the answers that did come carried a copied `<nick>` in front.
//
//   "Output only the translation of the last message, nothing else." —
//   but only when something stands above the line for the model to mistake
//   for it (a topic, the data block, the earlier lines, the reply target).
//   With context it is what stops the model answering a neighbouring line;
//   on a bare request it is one instruction too many and measurably costs
//   the translation.
