// The reading-side scheduler (spec § queue.ts). One instance per network:
// a FIFO ordered by the caller's priority (the active channel first), then
// live lines before history ones, then arrival; one request in flight per
// engine so the GPU and CPU engines
// overlap, LLM items of one channel and pair batched as numbered lines,
// items that fell DROP_AFTER_LINES messages behind dropped, and an engine
// paused after PAUSE_AFTER_FAILURES consecutive failures — for
// PAUSE_RESUME_MS, since a pause is a minute off and not the end of
// reading, and never for a torn-down worker or a foreign abort, which put
// the batch back at the front of its engine's queue instead. A multi-line
// message is never batched with others and goes through the composer's own
// line logic (`translateDraft`), so every line of it is translated. The
// queue owns span restoration: items arrive protected and updates carry
// restored text — and since a message is protected when it arrives but
// routed when it runs, the marker form its engine reads (spans.ts
// `renderMarkers`) is chosen here, once the route has answered, and kept on
// the `Queued` record that both the request and the restore are built from.
// A line judged untranslated (an echo, a narration, an answered question)
// is retried once bare, the composer's `bareRetry` shape, before it fails.
// Vue-free; reader.ts feeds it and writes its updates to the store.
