/**
 * The push worker's i18n: the same Vue-free resolver the app uses
 * (client/js/i18n/core.ts, en bundled with it), with the overlay fetched
 * per tag instead of webpack-imported. A classic service worker may only
 * importScripts while it installs, so a lazy webpack chunk reached from
 * the push handler could never load — the compiled catalogs are copied to
 * public/locales/ by the build instead, and the overlay is fetched
 * same-origin from the app root (the worker's script URL is the app root,
 * so the URL needs no configuration and no scope mapping).
 *
 * The worker awaits applyLocale on every push, before composing any
 * reader-visible string — the locale can change between pushes and no page
 * may be open to apply it for us. The app root and the fetch both come
 * from the caller (client/service-worker.js derives the root from its
 * registration scope; worker-entry.ts binds the worker's global fetch), so
 * this module stays free of `self` — that is what lets
 * test/tests/service-worker.ts install it in the vm sandbox with its own
 * transport.
